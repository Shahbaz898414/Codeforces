Obiedtive of ething is to selectively remore material
using imaged photo resist as a masking template.

Etch processes for MEMS fabrication differ from
traditional etch process for TI industry.

Etching is used to create structures for functional use
and to remove oxide layers belows features to allow
for motion.
