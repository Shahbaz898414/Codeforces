/*

photolithography is the process that defines and
transfers pattern onto a thin film layer on the
wafer
In the process a light soource is used to  transfer an
image from a pattern mask to a photosensitive layer
(photresist or resist) on a substrate or another thin film.

Component for photolithography are photo resists mask
and uv light.
A positiye photo resist is a type of photo resist in which
the portion of the photo resist that is exposed to light
becomes soluble to the photo resist developer.
A negate photo resist is a type of photresist in which
the portion of the photresist that is expsed to light
becomes insoluble to the photo resist developer
