/*


Look, it is not at all that a girl like
Hinata cannot exist in our world
but the girls of our world
do not want to be like Hinata

or have you ever seen a girl
who loves a boy whom
the whole world hates?

The one who doesn't have a single friend
is a bit raw in mind
and is also financially unstable
like Narutoo

but girls like boys who are
popular, handsome
intelligent, fool and are also
financially stable

In your efforts to find a handsome person,
They lost a good hearted person
