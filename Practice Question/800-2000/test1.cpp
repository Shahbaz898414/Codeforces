Built Kubernetes Cluster on AWS from Scratch with Minukube.Setup and Managed Docker Containers for Django and React Applications into Kubernetes Pods.Â 
Managed Deployment, Replication, Autohealing, auto scalingfor Kubernetes Cluster.
Managed network and Services with Host IP allocation through Proxy on
AWS EC2 and Route53.
Achievement: Reduced Downtime by 75% on Production Environments.



I independently constructed an reliable Kubernetes cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Minikube. This allowed for management and orchestration of containers.


I successfully transformed Django and React applications into containers seamlessly integrating them into Kubernetes pods. I also ensured deployment and scalability by managing Docker containers.


With proficiency I handled the deployment, replication and auto scaling of applications within the Kubernetes cluster. Additionally I implemented healing mechanisms to maintain availability and optimal performance.


To enhance stability I orchestrated network and services management by setting up proxies on AWS EC2 instances. Furthermore I utilized Route53 for host IP allocation. As a result of these efforts downtime, in production environments was reduced by a 75%, significantly improving application stability.




can you make points for me to add in my resume  of project section hist like in my own word
like i am writting. i want just 4 point like summary
